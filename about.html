                <h2>How BBQ School started</h2>
                <p>It all started in 2016 when I first my own Kamado Joe BBQ grill. I've hade many different BBQ grills before but always felt like it was impossible to keep the temperature in the grill to what it should be.
                    So when I got this grill, it was exactly the same. However, with this grill I had so many different ways to impact the temperature and I soon learned how to master it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After a while family members and friends was invy of the skills I had begun to master, and always wanted me to guide them on how to do it.
                    Here is where the idea of sharing my skills with everyone came to be. I thought that the easiest way to connect with as many BBQ lovers out there as possible was to create a website and throught it
                    be able to hold online courses as not everyone has the ability to travel to my home for a course.
                </p>
                <p>I am so happy that I did this and I have helped so many people start their BBQ journey and there is no better feeling than when you have helped someone become better at something they love.</p>
