## Wireframes (Balsamiq)
I created the wireframes for this site with Balsamiq. All wireframes can be found in the folder called [Balsamiq](https://github.com/gStarhigh/pro1/tree/main/assets/balsamiq).
The wireframes should not be considered finished product, but as a tool I used as inspiration when creating the website.

## General features
- The website is responsive on all devices.

        - The header is the same on all devices above 490px. Under 490px the header becomes a column instead. 
        - The header is a sticky header, meaning it will stay at the top of the screen even if you scroll down.
        - The header is responsive on all devices.
        - When you hover over the links in the header the text will underline and the font size increases. 
        - When you click on a link in the header, the font and letter spacing increases to easy indicate what page you are currently on.

### Home Page
- The home page, or index page, is the first page you see when you open the website. It's a big hero banner with a simple text that says "BBQ School". The banner is not clickable but it transforms when you first open the page. This is true for all pages where the banner is displayed. 
- Underneath the banner is a headline and a short introduction to the website and the idea behind it. 
- Beneath the introduction section, there is a small banner which also is a link with the encouragement to sign up for our weekly newsletter. Clicking it will take you to the sign up page. 
- Beneath the Sign up banner, there are 4 navigation images which, when clicked, either takes you to the courses page, the sign up page, the gallery page, or the about us page. 
    - When you hover over these images, another image will appear, to make the website more alive and fun. The text remains the same. 
- Under these navigation images the footer lies. 

### Courses Page
- The courses page starts with the hero banner, which transforms when you arrive at the page. 
- Below the hero banner there is a headline and a little information and text to encourage you to sign up for a course. 
- Below the information text, there is a sign up banner, which is the same as the one on the home page. 
- Below the sign up banner, is 6 courses. When hovered, the 2 first courses unblur, and the other flips, and shows another picture and information about the course.

    - The first 2 courses are blurred out with the text "Coming soon", to implement that the business are always adding new courses and to encourage customers to return to the page to see if they are now available or if new courses are coming. 
    - After those are the 2 two "New" courses and then the 2 "Most popular" courses.

- Below the courses, are a banner with a bookmark icon, with encouragement to revisit the site as we add new courses all the time.
- Below the stay tuned banner is the 4 navigation images again.
- At the bottom of the page lies the footer.

### Sign Up Page
- The sign up page does not have the same Hero image as the home and courses page. Here is a background image covering the entire main page with a form on it. 
- The form requires you to:
    - Fill in a First Name (An asterix indicates that this is mandatory)
    - Fill in a Last Name (An asterix indicates that this is mandatory)
    - Fill in a email address (An asterix indicates that this is mandatory)
    - There is a rolldown option with the courses where you chose what course to take (optional, in case you only want the newsletter)
    - Chose one of the 3 radio buttons.
    - There is a submit button, and a reset button. 
    - The submit button takes you to a "Congratulations page" where you are thanked for signing up.
    - The reset button, resets the form, and you can start over. 

### Gallery Page
- The gallery page contains all images used throughout the site, except for the hero banner image. All images are either my own or belongs to a friend (See credits section).
- The gallery page is responsive and goes from 4 images width to 2, depending on the size of your screen.
- The images are meant to not be the same size as to make it more fun to watch them all. 

### About page
- The About page has the hero banner again.
- Below that is some information about the person behind the site, how the site came to be and how to contact the site owner.
- Below the information section lies the footer.
