## General features
- The website is responsive on all devices.
- The website is using the same color and font throughout the entire site to make it easy to read and understand, no matter where you are. 
- The website has the same navigation elements on all pages except the gallery page, which only has the header. 
    - ### Header
        - The header is the same on all pages.
        - The header is the same on all devices.
        - The header is a sticky header, meaning it will stay at the top of the screen even if you scroll down.
        - The header is responsive on all devices.
        - When you hover over the links in the header the text will underline and the font size increases. 
        - When you click on a link in the header, the font and letter spacing increases to easy indicate what page you are currently on.
